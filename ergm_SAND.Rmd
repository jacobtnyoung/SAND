## Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
These lectures examine the logic of generative models for network data. The first lecture (Introduction to ERGMs) introduces the exponential random graph model (ERGM) as a flexible tool for specifying network configurations that generate global network structures. The accompanying lab (Introduction to ERGMs lab) provides an overview of different dependence specifications of the model (e.g. dyadic independence) and working with node level attributes using the ergm package. The second lab (Simulation and Goodness of Fit) examines functions for goodness of fit and simulation in the ergm package. A comprehensive archive of materials, discussion, syntax, papers, etc. for the ergm package is available at the statnet website. In addition, a problem set (with solutions) is provided to work through the material covered.

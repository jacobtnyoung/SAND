## *Course Overview*

This course provides a survey of the various tools used when analyzing networks. The overarching goal of the course is that, upon completion, students will be capable of developing research questions from a network perspective and incorporating network-based tools in their own research. The course is designed to be primarily methodological, dedicating the majority of the time to working through the mechanics of network-based tools. Students will also gain experience with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), a commonly used software program for network data management, analysis, and visualization. We will also work in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

## Centrality
This lecture provides an introduction to centrality measures for individual nodes as well as centralization measures for graphs. In particular, the following centrality measures are described: degree, closeness, and betweenness. The accompanying labs (Degree Centrality Lab, Closeness & Betweenness Centrality Lab) provide an overview of these measures using the [sna](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sna/index.html) package in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). In addition, a problem set (with solutions) is provided to work through the material covered.

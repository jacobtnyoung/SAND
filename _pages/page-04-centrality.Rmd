## *Centrality*

----

<br>

This lecture provides an introduction to centrality measures for individual nodes as well as centralization measures for graphs. In particular, the following centrality measures are described:  

  + Degree  
  
  + Closeness  
  
  + Betweenness
  
The accompanying labs provide an overview of these measures using the [sna](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sna/index.html) package in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). In addition, a problem set (with solutions) is provided to work through the material covered.

## Cohesive Subgroups
This lecture provides an introduction to the conceptualization of cohesion in networks. The lecture examines various operationalizations of cohesion by examining definitions of subgroups. Specifically, the lecture covers cliques, n-cliques, k-cores, and community detection algorithms. The accompanying lab (Cohesive Subgroups Lab) provide an overview of these measures using the [igraph](https://igraph.org/redirect.html) and the [sna](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sna/index.html) package in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/).

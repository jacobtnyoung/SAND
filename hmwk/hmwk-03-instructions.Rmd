# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with how networks are created and examined in *R*.  

## Part I

In homework #1 you created two networks and in homework #2 you plotted those networks. 

I would like you to continue working with those networks for this assignment. With a slight modification. I want you to work with *directed* networks for this assignment. If your networks are already directed, your good to go! If not, convert the edges to directed ties.

Then, for *each* network you created, do the following:  

### Degree

1. Calculate the indegree and outdegree for each actor.  
2. Calculate the mean indegree and outdegree.  
3. What is the interpretation of the mean?  
4. Compare the two means. How do they differ (if at all)? What is the meaning of this difference?

### Standardized Degree

5. Calculate the **standardized** indegree and outdegree for each actor.  
6. What is the interpretation of the mean?  
7. Compare the two means. How do they differ (if at all)? What is the meaning of this difference?

### Plotting

8. Plot each network where the **size of the node** corresponds to the indegree or outdegree. You can use the unstandardized or standardized value.
9. Are the similarities/differences you observed in the mean indegree/outdegree observable in the plot? Explain.

### Degree Centralization

10. Calculate the graph degree centralization for the unstandarized indegree and outdegree.  
11. Interpret the graph degree centralization score for each network.
12. Compare the two graph degree centralization scores. Are they similar/different? Explain what the similarity or difference means.

## Part II

How them work with a network here. Take one two of the trust networks from WO-PINS. Have them then make some comparisons.

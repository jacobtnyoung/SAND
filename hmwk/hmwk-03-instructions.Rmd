# Introduction

The purpose of this homework is to familiarize yourself with calculating degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores as well as centralization scores for undirected and directed networks in *R*. 

In Parts I and II of this homework we will use two new networks (described below). In Part III, you will use the two networks you created from [Homework 1](../hmwk/hmwk-01-instructions.html) and [Homework 2](../hmwk/hmwk-02-instructions.html).


<br>

## Part I: Working with an Undirected Network

For this part of the homework you will use data from [Thomas Grund and James Densley's study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1043986214553377) of ties among members of an inner-city gang in London, England. The network is undirected, binary ties collected from anonymized arrests data. We will refer to this network as the `LondonGangNet`. Note that the object is of class `network`. To coerce the object to be an object of class `matrix`, use the `as.matrix()` function.

<br>

For the `LondonGangNet` network, do the following:  

1. Calculate the degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  
2. Calculate the standardized degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  
3. Calculate the mean degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality score.
4. Compare the differences for the three mean centrality scores for each measure of centrality.
5. Calculate the graph centralization for degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.  
6. Discuss the graph centralization score for closeness centrality.
7. Discuss the graph centralization score for betweenness centrality.
8. Compare the differences for the three graph centralization scores for each measure of centrality.
9. Plot the network three times using the `gplot()` function where each plot sizes the nodes by the centrality score (i.e. a plot for degree centrality, a plot for closeness centrality, and a plot for betweenness centrality).
10. Examine the plots. Describe how the differences you noted between the centrality measures above are seen in the plots.

<br>

## Part II: Working with a Directed Network

For this part of the homework you will use data from [Mangia Natarajan's study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-006-9007-x) of a large cocaine trafficking organization in New York City. The network is directed, binary ties of communication between individuals collected from police wiretaps of 151 telephone conversations. We will refer to this network as the `CocaineDealingNet`. Note that the object is of class `network`. To coerce the object to be an object of class `matrix`, use the `as.matrix()` function.

<br>

For the `CocaineDealingNet` network, do the following:  

1. Calculate the indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  
2. Calculate the standardized indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality scores for each actor.  
3. Calculate the mean indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality score.
4. Compare the differences for the four mean centrality scores for each measure of centrality.
5. Calculate the graph centralization for indegree, outdegree, closeness, and betweenness centrality.  
6. Discuss the graph centralization score for closeness centrality.
7. Discuss the graph centralization score for betweenness centrality.
8. Compare the differences for the four graph centralization scores for each measure of centrality.
9. Plot the network four times using the `gplot()` function where each plot sizes the nodes by the centrality score (i.e. a plot for indegree centrality, a plot for outdegree centrality, a plot for closeness centrality, and a plot for betweenness centrality).
10. Examine the plots. Describe how the differences you noted between the centrality measures above are seen in the plots.

<br>

## Part III:

Pick **one** of your networks from [Homework 1](../hmwk/hmwk-01-instructions.html) and [Homework 2](../hmwk/hmwk-02-instructions.html) and do the following:

  * If the network is *undirected*, repeat the steps in Part I.  
  
  * If the network is *directed*, repeat the steps in Part II.

<br>

## Using the Template, Knitting, and Submitting

For this homework, you will use a .Rmd template I have created. Download the [template for this homework](../hmwk/templates/hmwk-03-template.zip?raw=true) prior to beginning the homework. For all the homework assignments, be sure to show both the solution for your code and write out your answers in the body text (were relevant). When you have completed your assignment, click the "Knit" button to render your `.RMD` file into a `.HTML` report. 

A physical copy of the assignment must be turned in during class on the corresponding due date. This assignment is *DUE* on **2/21**.

<br>

### Common Knitting Issues

`.RMD` files are knit into `.HTML` and other formats procedural, or line-by-line.

* An error in code when knitting will halt the process; error messages will tell you the specific line with the error
* Certain functions like `install.packages()` or `setwd()` are bound to cause errors in knitting 
* Altering a dataset or variable in one chunk will affect their use in all later chunks
* If an object is "not found", make sure it was created or loaded with `library()` in a previous chunk

**If All Else Fails:** If you cannot determine and fix the errors in a code chunk that's preventing you from knitting your document, add `eval = FALSE` inside the brackets of `{r}` at the beginning of a chunk to ensure that R does not attempt to evaluate it, that is: `{r eval = FALSE}`. This will prevent an erroneous chunk of code from halting the knitting process.

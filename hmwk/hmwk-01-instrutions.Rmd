# Introduction

For the first homework, I would like you to construct a network. Think about a type of relationship that is interesting, important, etc. and what it connects. Whatever floats your boat. It can be a real example from your life, something fictitious, anything really. 

**IMPORTANT**: *read through this entire assignment before deciding what you will choose*.

## Part I

*After making your decision, do the following*:

### A. Describe the network 

  1. Is the network one mode or multi-mode?
  2. What do the points (i.e. nodes) represent? (note: if multiple modes, be sure to describe each mode)
  3. What do the ties (i.e. edges) represent?
  4. Are the ties simplex or multiplex? (note: if multiplex, be sure to describe each edge)
  5. Are the ties undirected or directed? Binary/Weighted/Signed?
  6. Why type of edge is it? (social relationship? Interactions? Flow?)
  7. Why did you pick this network?
    
### B. Draw a picture of the network (by hand is fine)
  
### C. Draw the adjacency matrix for the network (by hand is fine)

____  

## Part II

*After completing Part I, do the following*:

### Choose a new network and repeat Part I


## Instructions

The assignment needs to be emailed to me by the due date of **DATE**.

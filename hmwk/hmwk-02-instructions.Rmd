# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize yourself with how networks are created and examined in *R*.  

## Part I

In homework #1 you created two networks. I would like you to continue working with those networks for this assignment.

For *each* network you created, do the following:  

1. Import the network into *R* and create an object of class `network`.    
2. Plot the network using the `gplot()` function.    
3. Modify the plot using at least three arguments in the `gplot()` function.  

## Part II

How them work with a network here. Take one two of the trust networks from WO-PINS. Have them then make some comparisons.

# Instructions

For this assignment, you will use the template NAME located LOCATION.
